Numerical Attributes:
p_date: All values are constant (20230807), so no variation to simulate here.
ad_id: Unique identifier for each ad.
punish_num: Number of punishments for ads, mostly around 1.
latest_punish_begin_date: Seems to be in a timestamp format.
ad_revenue: Revenue generated by the ad, ranging from 0 to 27100.62.
avg_ad_revenue: Average revenue, ranging from 0 to 17144.50.
start_time: Start time of the ad, in timestamp format.
baseline_st: Baseline metric for the ad, ranging from 0.54 to 7.59.
Categorical Attributes:
delivery_country: 59 unique countries.
queue_market: 51 unique markets.
product_line: 4 unique product lines.
task_type_en: 9 unique task types.


The histograms give us an overview of the distributions of the numerical attributes. We see that:
p_date is a constant value, so there's no variation to simulate.
ad_id appears to be a unique identifier, so we would ideally generate unique values for this attribute.
punish_num is mostly centered around 1, but we do see a long tail, suggesting a skewed distribution.
latest_punish_begin_date, start_time, ad_revenue, and avg_ad_revenue show a variety of patterns, some of which are highly skewed.
baseline_st seems to be multimodal, with a few peaks at specific values.


The correlation heatmap provides insights into the relationships between the numerical attributes:
p_date is a constant, so it doesn't have any meaningful correlation with other variables.
ad_id doesn't show significant correlation with other variables, which is expected for a unique identifier.
ad_revenue and avg_ad_revenue are moderately correlated (0.47 0.47), suggesting that if one goes up, the other is likely to as well.
latest_punish_begin_date and start_time have a moderate negative correlation (−0.44 −0.44).
Other correlations between numerical variables are relatively weak.
